          It is the year 2021! Finally 2020 is over, and things are looking very promising. 
          I am excited to change myself for the better and do something meaningful this year.
          However, I did not end up making a new year resolution. There are several reasons: one 
          is that I don't have the habit of making one; Two, I am not the type of person that 
          tell my goals to everyone, I guess it just doesn't work for me.

          I personaly think that I cam count as a self driven person, but it's summer time. I don't want
          to waste my time too much, but I know I want to take a break. Since I have nothing else better to do, I
          decided to give it a shot and joined the girls who code summer online program.

          For the past couple of months, people were stuck at home and my
          birthday went by at a blink of the eye. I didn't wake up until late in
          the morning, and nothing seems special for this day. I did what I do everyday, 
          get up, grab something to eat, and all the stuff that I usually do.
          I almost forgot that it is my birthday, it just seems so... usual.
          Time sure flies by, and it is both rewarding and depressing.
          I feel like by this age I should know better, but I still feel like an 
          ant looking up into the sky and wandering how it is so high up.
